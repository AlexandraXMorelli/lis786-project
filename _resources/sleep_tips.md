Getting enough sleep every night is important for reducing stress and improving concentration. It is recommended to aim for at least 8 hours a day and to reduce blue light exposure before going to bed.This will help you to get the most out of your sleep.

It is also a good idea to go to sleep and wake up around the same time every day so that you get used to a routine.
