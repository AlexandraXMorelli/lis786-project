One great way to lower stress is to meditate. This simple activity can be done with just a timer. It is recommended to start with *15 minutes* a day and increase the number of minutes as you become more comfortable with meditation.

 There are also several different poses you can choose while meditating. Some of them involve standing, sitting or walking. It may be easiest to start with a sitting position.
